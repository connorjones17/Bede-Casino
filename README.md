<h3>Setup</h3>

Clone this repository to your local machine

``` $ git clone git@github.com:connorjones17/Bede-Casino.git ```

Go to directory

``` $ cd Bede-Casino ```

Install all the dependencies using npm

``` $ npm install ```

Run the gulp command to compile all our css files into one index.css file or feel free to watch if you want make constant updates to the css

``` 
$ gulp 
  OR
$ gulp watch
```

Run webpack which will compile all our React.js components and some other plugins that are useful to us.
This may take a second to compile and it will start up a server for you so please be patient at this moment :)

``` $ npm run start ```

If you are curious to see what webpack outputs you can run this command and it will compile everything to the dist/ directory

`` $ npm run create ```
